# Training Mode

Training Mode in Lost Circuit is designed to help players hone their racing skills, familiarize themselves with different tracks, and master the game’s mechanics. This mode provides a stress-free environment where players can practice at their own pace, without the pressure of competing against others. It’s an ideal setting for both new players learning the basics and experienced racers looking to refine their techniques.
